# Advanced Digital Circuits

This repository contains advanced digital circuits when compared to the Introduction folder (i.e.: Machines performing high-level algorithms). This repository also contains a project that uses VGA, PS/2, and Speakers to interact with the outside world. Such project implements a side-scrolling game called Dyno's Adventure. Please feel free to check Dyno's Adventure on the corresponding submodule. 

# Dependencies
* Everything is self-contained in this repository. All you need is your DE1 SoC board and a toolchain.

# Usage
* Check the report in each directory (ex: Lab5/report.pdf) to learn if you need to connect any peripherals, instructions on how to use it, and more documentation
* Build and upload to your SoC
* Have fun!

# Dyno's-Adventure

Dyno's Adventure main character is Dyno, a brave knight who lives in a very dangerous world. Dyno must avoid the dangers and try to live as much as possible. The game is for the DE1 SoC board, but should be easily ported to other SoCs by modifying the top-level module with the correct sources for Audio, VGA, PS/2, and Clock signals.

More instructions and information can be found in the README.md file of the corresponding submodule for the Final Project


# Are you a brave warrior willing to take the challenge?
