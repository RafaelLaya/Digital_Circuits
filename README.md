# Digital_Circuits

This repository includes a collection of basic and advanced digital circuits in SystemVerilog. Please see the respective directories for more information. The circuits can be simulated or can be run on the DE1 SoC board, and should be easily ported to other SoCs by providing the correct signals on the top-level files (Audio, PS/2, LEDs, Switches, Clock Sources, etc)
