# Introduction To Digital Circuits
This repository contains a series of basic digital logic circuits as well as a final project. The final project uses an LED array to make a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game. Please read final\_project/report.pdf for an instruction manual on how to play the game. 

# Dependencies
* None other than your toolchain and your DE1 SoC board as everything is self-contained in this repository

# Usage
* For any laboratory, simply build and upload to your DE1\_SoC board 
* For the final project, you need a 16x16 Bi-Color LED Expansion Board. Unfortunately, it is a custom piece of hardware and I don't know of any commercial pieces nor I have the design files.However, it should be easy to port into any other 16x16 (or bigger) LED matrix by replacing that single module
